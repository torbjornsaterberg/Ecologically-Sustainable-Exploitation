## A multispecies approach for fisheries management

This repository contains all the R-code and time series data needed to conduct the analyses described in [Säterberg et al. 2019; Fish & Fisheries](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12390).

### Run the analyses
Start by sourcing the code in "Pipeline.R". Code for producing all figures and tables is available in "Figures.R". 

All analyses are coded as functions. Figure 1 can for example be produced using the command: Figure1(param,Criteria).
